  Adds public test data, as an addition to the existing Gammapy test data, by
  having a zip compressed file, containing ``Fermi-LAT`` data generated with
  ``fermipy`` for Crab Nebula observations. The CI checks for the presence of
  downloaded ``gammapy-data`` and it being saved in the environ path variable
  of the system, and only then unzips the additional data, in the same location,
  in a folder named ``fermipy-crab``.

  Using these updated test data, starts building simple pytests by using test
  template config files in ``tests`` module. The additional support of DL4 data
  input, will help in replicating some tests done in Gammapy, to check the
  additional support by Asgardpy.

  create SEDs. [`#68 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/68>`_]

- Remove GTI selections from 3D datasets, as at least for Fermi-LAT datasets,
  the files are produced for a select set of GTI time intervals amongst other
  selections and the various files produced, are exclusive for these selections.

  GADF-DL3 type of 1D dataset can still have GTI selection option, but it should
  correspond to the GTI interval for the Fermi-LAT data.

- Update reading of Model parameters from XML file, by including the
  ``spectrum_type`` information as defined in the original format. This helps
  for Spectral Models like Exponential Cutoff Power Law, Broken Power Law and
  Super-Exponential Cutoff Power Law as used in the 4FGL catalog, where Gammapy
  uses different formulae and parameter names. Resolves a part of the Issue
  [`#52 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/issues/52>`_].

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fixes ``python_requires`` version in setup.py.
  [`#8 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/8>`_]

- Try to fix some coding styles to avoid test errors by using isort and
  suggestions from pylint. [`#10 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/10>`_]

- Update Changelog and fix an earlier commit change.
  [`#17 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/17>`_]

- Fix adding exclusion regions in 3D dataset and assuming a
  ``CircleAnnulusSkyRegion`` to be the first exclusion region type.
  [`#40 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/40>`_]

- Fixing assignment of Dataset models to be done in the ``analysis`` module and
  not in each DL4 dataset creation module.

  Check for diffuse background models before enlisting them, and perform any
  additional tasks as required.

  Have the model information of the target source, read from XML file, be the
  first entry in the list of Models.

  Correct the parameter values as defined in Fermi-XML models, by updating the
  units, scaling factors, range of values, and generating a list of Gammapy
  ``Parameter`` objects, to then generate the respective Models object.
  Add links to the Fermi-XML definitions for reference in docstrings.

  Fix the condition on when to use the model information for the target source,
  given in the ``AsgardpyConfig`` file or continue with the information in the
  XML file. [`#42 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/42>`_]

- Fixing Flux Points Analysis step, to get instrument-specific flux points by
  using ``instrument_spectral_info`` dict object, containing the relevant
  instrument-specific information.

  This information is used to sort the datasets provided for the ``flux-points``
  step, with the respective energy binning and dataset names.
  [`#44 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/44>`_]

- Cleaning of logging information and updating doc-strings.
  [`#47 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/47>`_]

- Fix mypy check errors in default values of different variables.
  [`#48 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/48>`_]

- Fix variable assignment issue from previous PR by using a new Config variable
  ``PathType`` which uses strings of paths and reads them as ``pathlib.Path``
  objects. [`#50 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/50>`_]

- Clean the pipeline from all outputs, irrelevant comments and reference to any
  private data in config files or notebooks.
  [`#51 <https://github.com/chaimain/asgardpy/pull/51>`_]
