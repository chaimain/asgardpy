# Additional Fermi-LAT data

The fermipy_crab_zipped.zip file contains a set of Crab Nebula (+ Crab Pulsar) data, produced
using [fermipy](https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), graciously provided
by [Lea Heckmann](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6653-8407), to be read with
Gammapy (via Asgardpy).

The data is generated for the time exposure from January 2019 - May 2022.

The zipped file also contains several extra files to aid in covering tests for
support provided by Asgardpy, for reading such files.

# Additional CTAO-LST1 data

The lst1_crab_dl4.zip file contains the reduced DL4 dataset of the Crab Nebula
example dataset from the [LST1 Performance Study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace89d),
stored on the public record at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11445184),
provided by [Daniel Morcuende](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9400-0922). The
original dataset were DL3 files and over 750 MBs in size, hence they were
reduced to DL4 data and stored here for easier access.

Detailed information about the data can be found at the links provided.
