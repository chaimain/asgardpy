Reasons for using Asgardpy over Gammapy v1.3
============================================

#. Having common central location of the spatial geom of the DL4 dataset.
#. Using the High Level Interface for 1D dataset with energy-dependent RAD_MAX cuts (geom using PointSkyRegion)
#. Having intermediate analysis steps, distinct for DL3->DL4->DL5

#. Easily reading Fermi XML files into Gammapy Models
#. Providing Goodness of Fit estimation for 3D+1D datasets
#. Distinct functions to fetch the EBL-deabsorbed spectra and model of a dataset

#. Using multiple time interval selection for a given list of observations.
#. Comprehensive selection on list of models in the FoV.
#. Useful scripts and functions to help with the spectral analyses.
