Reasons for using Asgardpy over Gammapy v1.3
============================================

Main reasons
------------

The simple main reasons are the following -

#. Only for 3D + 1D analysis from the DL3 level

#. Using HLI for 1D with energy-dependent RAD_MAX values

#. Additional supporting features while using the HLI

Detailed list
-------------

Following are the detailed reasons for using asgardpy -

#. Having common central location of the spatial geom of the DL4 dataset.

#. Using the High Level Interface for 1D dataset with energy-dependent RAD_MAX cuts (geom using PointSkyRegion)

#. Having intermediate analysis steps, distinct for DL3->DL4->DL5

#. Being able to read Fermi files as produced by enrico and fermipy

#. Easily reading Fermi XML files into Gammapy Models

#. Providing Goodness of Fit estimation for 3D+1D datasets

#. Distinct functions to fetch the EBL-deabsorbed spectra and model of a dataset

#. Using multiple time interval selection for a given list of observations.

#. Comprehensive selection on list of models in the FoV.

#. Useful scripts and functions to help with the spectral analyses.
