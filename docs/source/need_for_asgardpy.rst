Reasons for using Asgardpy over Gammapy v1.3
============================================

Main reasons
------------

The simple main reasons are the following -

#. For [3D + 1D joint analysis](https://docs.gammapy.org/1.3/tutorials/analysis-3d/analysis_mwl.html), starting from DL3 level data

#. Using [HLI](https://docs.gammapy.org/1.3/user-guide/hli.html) for 1D with energy-dependent RAD_MAX values

#. Additional supporting features while using [HLI](https://docs.gammapy.org/1.3/user-guide/hli.html)

Unique reasons
--------------

Some of the unique features in asgardpy are -

#. While creating a multi-instrument list of DL4 datasets, letting the central spatial coordinate if the geom objects, be commonly shared

#. Being able to read Fermi files as produced by enrico and fermipy

#. Easily reading existing Fermi XML files into Gammapy Models objects

#. Useful scripts and functions to help with the spectral analyses.

Reasons that may be added in future Gammapy releases
----------------------------------------------------

The following features may become redundant in asgardpy -

#. Using the High Level Interface for 1D dataset with energy-dependent RAD_MAX cuts

#. Having intermediate analysis steps, distinct for DL3 -> DL4 -> DL5

#. Providing Goodness of Fit estimation for 3D + 1D datasets

#. Using multiple time interval selection for a given list of observations.
