**asgardpy pipeline**
=====================

Gammapy-based pipeline to support high-level analysis for multi-instruments joint datasets.
Follow the `Gammapy v1.1 <https://docs.gammapy.org/1.1/>`_ documentation for understanding the core Gammapy objects.

The various Data Levels used here follow the descriptions suggested by
`GADF v0.3 <https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and CTAO Data Model.

The pipeline was developed with first testing with Fermi-LAT (`enrico <https://enrico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
`fermipy <https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_) files and LST-1 (`cta-lstchain <https://cta-observatory.github.io/cta-lstchain/>`_)
DL3 files (with energy-dependent and global selection cuts) for point-like sources.

The pipeline can be further expanded to support more types of DL3 files of gamma-ray instruments.
See some example notebooks and tests, which use the public data used in Gammapy Tutorials, with an additional Fermi-LAT data.
